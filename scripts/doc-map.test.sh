#
# WHY: the token cost of what an agent loads at session start is invisible. It regressed twice —
# CLAUDE.md grew to ~184KB of inlined rule bodies (silently truncated, so it neither fit nor was
# complete), and every Cursor .mdc was marked alwaysApply so the whole corpus force-loaded anyway.
# Nothing measured it, so nothing could notice. These cases make it observable.
#
# A canary must be able to FAIL. Each case below is mutation-checked by construction: it asserts a
# number or a property that a plausible edit would break.
