#!/bin/sh
# doc-map — a generated index of this repo's documents, for agents.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: an agent asked to "update the docs" otherwise greps, opens files, and reads
# whole documents to find out which one is relevant. On a repo whose docs are 5x its code (panoply:
# 1.82MB of markdown vs 341KB of shell), that is the dominant token cost — and it is paid before any
# useful work starts. This prints a table: what each doc is FOR, how big it is, and when it changed.
# Read ~2k tokens of index, then open the one or two documents that matter.
#
# WHAT IT IS NOT: it does not summarise content, and it does not replace reading a doc you intend to
# edit. It answers *which* doc and *whether it is worth it* — nothing more. A map that pretends to
# know what a doc says is worse than no map, because you stop looking.
#
# NO DEPENDENCIES. POSIX sh + awk. No python, no tree-sitter, no index to keep fresh: it reads the
# tree as it is right now, so it cannot go stale. A cached map is the failure mode of every code-map
# tool; the cheap way to never be stale is to not cache.
#
# USAGE
#   sh scripts/doc-map.sh                 human table for the whole repo
#   sh scripts/doc-map.sh --dir docs/agents   limit to a subtree
#   sh scripts/doc-map.sh --json          machine-readable (for an agent to parse)
#   sh scripts/doc-map.sh --check         exit 1 if a doc is missing the header this relies on
#
# ESCAPE: DOC_MAP_OFF=1 makes --check a no-op (for a repo mid-migration).

set -u

# Flags are parsed in a LOOP. The earlier single-shot `case "$1"` accepted only one flag, so
# `--dir X --check` silently ignored `--check` and printed a table instead of checking — a run that
# looked like it validated a subtree and had not. Any multi-flag call was quietly wrong.
